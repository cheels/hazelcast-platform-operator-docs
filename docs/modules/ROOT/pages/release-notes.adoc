= 5.6 Release Notes

This release introduced the xref:high-availability-mode.adoc[High Availability Mode] configuration and custom resources (CRs) for xref:cache-configuration.adoc[Cache] and xref:queue-configuration.adoc[Queue] data structures. We also added persistence support for the Cache CR and introduced a new way to install the Hazelcast Platform Operator, using Helm.

== New Features

* Introduced High Availability Mode configuration to create clusters that are resilient to node and zone failures (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/538[#538])
* Added support for the Queue CR (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/428[#428])
* Added support for the Cache CR (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/430[#430])
* Made persistence support for the Cache CR configurable (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/474[#474])
* Replaced the `autoForceStart` option with `startupAction`. When applied, `startupAction` allows you to trigger `Force Start` or `Partial Start` (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/511[#511])
* Introduced a new way to install the Hazelcast Platform Operator, using Helm

== Changes

* Added a connectivity check to the WAN Replication CR. When creating a WAN Replication CR, you can now check that the target cluster is reachable (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/541[#541])
* Added persistence for WAN Replication configurations. WAN Replication configurations are now stored in the Hazelcast ConfigMap so that when member containers restart, replication continues (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/513[#513])
* Added logic for recreating a Hazelcast client when the client is unable to access a cluster. When the client is unable to connect, the Hazelcast Platform Operator restarts it (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/500[#500])
* Updated CR validation to use a webhook. The Hazelcast Platform Operator can now report issues with CRs before they are applied (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/492[#492])
* Improved the approach for exposing API fields. Exposed API fields are now more consistent  (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/498[#498])
** Exposed API fields are now more consistent with each other
* Removed the `h.Spec.Persistence.DataLoadTimeoutSec` parameter (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/512[#512])
* Split `restore` and `restore_local` commands (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/471[#471])
* Updated the cluster activation logic to use the Go client (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/466[#466])
* Added `tilt-debug` support for the remote debugging of local Kubernetes clusters  (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/528[#528])
* Added `ClusterIDs` to Phone Home data (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/527[#527])
* Changed capabilities at CSV from Seamless Upgrades to Full Lifecycle, which is become visible on OCP OperatorHub dashboard(https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/476[#476])

== Fixed Issues

* A HotBackup can now be created before the Hazelcast cluster is ready (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/503[#503])
* Added webhook support for Operator Lifecycle Management (OLM) (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/540[#540])
* Sets a Hazelcast resource message when attempting to restore a hot backup that does not exist (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/514[#514])
* Multiple CRs for data structures can now be created and then stored correctly in the ConfigMap (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/501[#501])
* Added a security context to all containers for hostPath permissions (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/485[#485])
* Fixed the incorrect assignment of a variable in WanRep ConfigMap. After a restart, cluster members will now continue replicating map entries (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/554[#554])
* Hazelcast member status no longer contains an empty pod name field (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/456[#456])
