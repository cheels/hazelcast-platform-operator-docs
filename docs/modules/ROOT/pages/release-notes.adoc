= 5.5 Release Notes

In this release, we introduced custom resources (CRs) for xref:topic-configuration.adoc[Topic], xref:multimap-configuration.adoc[Multimap], and xref:replicatedmap-configuration.adoc[Replicated Map] data structures. We also added EntryListener support for the Map CR.

* Add a default value to resource Kind in WanReplication spec (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/374[#374])
* Added a namespaced Role and RoleBinding that are created and passed to the namespaced service account of the Hazelcast cluster to grant secret access (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/407[#407])
